# Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyph Translator

## Overview
The Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyph Translator is an NLP-based project designed to translate ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs into modern, readable text. The system focuses on interpreting symbolic representations and converting them into meaningful language while preserving semantic context.

This project aims to support historical analysis, educational use, and language interpretation through computational methods.

## Problem Statement
Ancient Egyptian hieroglyphs are complex symbolic representations that are difficult to interpret without expert knowledge. This project aims to:
- Assist in understanding ancient texts
- Automate the translation of hieroglyphic symbols
- Provide a scalable framework for ancient language processing

## Approach
1. Data Collection  
   - Hieroglyph symbol mappings and reference texts  

2. Text Preprocessing  
   - Symbol normalization  
   - Tokenization and cleaning  

3. Translation Logic  
   - Rule-based and pattern-mapping techniques  
   - Language transformation to modern text  

4. Output Generation  
   - Human-readable translated text
